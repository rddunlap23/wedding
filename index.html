                        <p>On the surface we seem like opposites - Ryan is a serious business professional with a Banana Republic wardrobe and Whitney is a talkative science nerd with a wardrobe of coffee (and really whatever she last ate) stained clothes.  However, on closer glance, we are united in our love of food, competitive streaks when playing games, and devotion to family.</p>
                        <p>We first met each other in 2005 In Davis, California. We were both in other relationships at the time, but we struck up a friendship based on shared activities and ability to talk trash.  We remained friends for many years prior to dating,  When we began dating, it was unclear how long it would last.  Ryan was transferring to New York for work, and Whitney has a strong need for nature in her life.  However, once Ryan moved to New York, late night phone calls, bicoastal flights, and facetime became the norm.  During this time, Ryan and Whitney realized how much they meant to each other.</p>
                        <p>Ryan proposed to Whitney at the New York Botanical Gardens in the desert plants room (Both details are important because Whitney loves plants, and she is especially fond of the ones that grow in harsh climates).  Whitney had no idea that Ryan was planning to propose, and she thought that he was acting kind of crazy on the day that he did propose.  He had planned at least 8 activities for said day in 3 of the 5 boroughs of NYC.  But, when he proposed, she was very excited and quite speechless, which is rather unusual for Whitney (see our happy engagement day photo.</p>
                        <p>Soon after the proposal Ryan asked to be transferred back to the bay. Ryan moved into Whitney's tiny one bedroom Berkeley apartment that was just barely big enough for her. Thankfully, they only had to live here for a few months until they were able to move into a nice big two bedroom house in Oakland where they are currently living.</p>
                        <p>And as they say the rest is history...</p>

                        <p>Howdy folks, Whitney Thornton here.</p>  
                        <p>I am originally from Bath, Ohio where I spent my childhood playing in the mud, chasing fireflies, and reading by flashlight in the dark. I grew up in a household where imagination was encouraged and love was freely given. </p>
                        <p>I now reside in Oakland, California where I spend my time playing (and working) in bay mud, loving nature, and obsessively reading to find new inspirations.  I am now committed to a household that values games, good food, and terrible puns.  And of course, this household will be filled with my love for Ryan, freely given. </p>

                        <p>Hi all, Ryan Dunlap here</p>
                        <p>I was born in Indiana, but didn't stay there for long. Over the next decade his family moved to Ohio, where his sister Molly was born, Illinois, Connecticut, Colorado, and then finally moved to Fresno California as he was about to start 5th grade.</p>
                        <p>I have been an avid athlete from a young age. In my grade school years I was never far from either the soccer field, basketball court, or the track. High school and college brought water polo, swimming, ultimate frisbee, rock climibing and the best sport of all innter-tube water polo. Post college years have added kick ball and dodgeball. Sports has always been a great way to meet new friends, which with living in 7 states came in very handy
                        </p>
                        <p>From Fresno I moved to Davis where I attended college at UC Davis. It was in Davis, post graduation while working in Sacramento, that I first met Whitney. I was always quite smitten with her, but little did I know at the time would become the love of my life.</p>
                        <p>My carreer has taken me from Sacramento to San Francisco to New York and back to SF again. It's in SF that I now reside with the love of my life Whitney.</p>

                        </h5>
                        <p>Offsite camping would be better for folks that want to camp with kids or want to combine wedding and nature for the weekend.  If this is you, we recommend forgoing the few camping options in Ben Lomand (mostly combo RV/camping spots) for the state park route.</p>

                        <p> Henry Cowell State Park is the closest state campground to the site (5.4 miles), but if you don't mind driving further or if you want cabins, we recommend checking out Big Basin Redwoods State Park (it is lovely). For both campgrounds, we recommend reserving early if you even think you are interested in offsite camping/cabins.  It is only 10 dollars to cancel a camping reservation, and reservations will start filling up soon! </p>  

                        <p> Here is a link to one of the many camping options around big basin that you can reserve: <a href="http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/little-basin-state-park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=CA&parkId=123507#sr">Little Basin Camping</a> If you are from out of town and interested in camping, but worried about gear, let use know.  We can try to scrounge up gear for you. </p>
