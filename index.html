                        <p>Ryan was born in Indiana, but didn't stay there for long. Over the next decade his family moved to Ohio, where his sister Molly was born, Illinois, Connecticut, Colorado, and then finally moved to Fresno as he was about to start 5th grade.</p>

                        <p>Jeffrey grew up in the Bay Area. Born in Fremont and growing up in San Rafael, he spent his youth drawing comics. In fact, he drew everything on this site!

                        He became enamored with the web early on â€” he made his first website in 1994. He's been constantly making them ever since, and lucky for him, it's an important tool of the trade in San Francisco.

                        He also loves video games, especially platformers and music games. He kept in shape throughout high school and college by playing Dance Dance Revolution. He's now more focused on long-distance running, but he's always got time for a trip to the arcade.

                        From his apartment in Hayes Valley, Jeffrey bikes down Market Street to work on the Embarcadero every day. He also bikes to Noisebridge, a local hackerspace, where he teaches a free class on frontend web development.</p>
